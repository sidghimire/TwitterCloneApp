## Start The Project

I will be using an external phone for development. You can use an android emulator too as long as it works perfectly fine.

Type the following code in the terminal to start the project. It may take sometime as we are running the file for the first time.
```
npx react-native run-android
```




# Development of the project

## Create a new account for twitter.

Below you will see different GUI screens made in Adobe Xd. Protyping an already existing app is essential as it reduces the mistakes you can make while managing Navigation.
